# Diabetes Prediction

### About
This is a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) web application that makes predictions about **diabetes** based on the patient data provided by the user.

### How it works
- Using the **Support Vector Classifier** model provided by the [Scikit-Learn library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html), prediction about diabetes based on the patient's medical details is made.
- This model has been trained on the [Diabetes Dataset for Beginners](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/diabetes-dataset-for-beginners) from **Kaggle** using standardization and stratification techniques.
